.. note:: We assume that by now you have already read the previous tutorials. If not, please check previous tutorials at `<http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_. You can also find the source code and resources at `<https://github.com/opencv-java/>`_

Goal
----
In this tutorial we are going to use well-known classifiers that have been already trained and distributed by OpenCV in order to detect and track a moving face into a video stream.


What we will do in this tutorial
--------------------------------
In this guide, we will:
 * Insert a checkbox to select the Haar Classifier, detect and track a face, and draw a green rectangle around the detected face.
 * Inesrt a checkbox to select the LBP Classifier, detect and track a face, and draw a green rectangle around the detected face.

Getting Started
---------------
Let's create a new JavaFX project. In Scene Builder set the windows element so that we have a Border Pane with:
